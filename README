Counter is a small process which counts upwards at a programmable interval.  It can also be asked to allocate a block of memory of varying size and write alternating zeros and ones (0x55 or ASCII: 'U') across the memory range before beginning its count.  This particular program was used in the debugging of memsnap.  It may also be useful in a quick test for other types of debuggers and tracers.
